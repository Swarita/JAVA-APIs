# JAVA-APIs

### About the project:
- Two REST APIs were requested and implemented using PircBot. 

#### APIs used:
 - A weather API from http://openweathermap.org/ was used so that if you enter a city or zipcode within the US, it displays the temperature in Fahrenheit.
 - A Friends quote API from http://friends-quotes-api.herokuapp.com to display a random quote from the "Friends" sit-com

#### How to use the APIs:
 - To use the weather bot, you enter "weather" or "temperature" into the input bar
 - To get a Friends quote, you enter "quote" into the input bar and once the message "getting quote.. enter anything to continue" appears, type in anything and press enter to generate quote
